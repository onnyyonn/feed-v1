So if a¬≤=2b¬≤, a must end with 0 and b must end with 5 or 0. This triggers an infinite descent that proves: no solution where a and b both are integers, which implies a/b must be irrational.",

Well, here is the deal: it can't be said if the climate change is responsible for a single event. But it can be estimated if it increases the likelihood of said event. This study shows how the increasing temperature in the Arabian sea is increasing the likelihood of severe cyclones and that explains why we're seeing them almost every year now, when earlier there used to be none.",
