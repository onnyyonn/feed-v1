# About

This repository hosts the contents of an RSS feed where I share links that I find interesting.
- Visit https://onnyyonn.github.io/feed to read the feed.
- Add https://onnyyonn.github.io/feed/feed.atom in your feed reader to get updates.

# How It Works

This repository is powered by osmos::feed, which is a web-based minimalistic RSS reader, leveraging the power of Github actions and pages. I am, however, not using it to read feeds, but to publish the contents of a personal RSS feed. Tiny Tiny RSS, my self-hosted RSS reader of choice, allows me to share links to that specific feed.
